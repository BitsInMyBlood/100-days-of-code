# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 18, 2018
// ##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Began my 100 days of coding challenge by restarting my work toward completing FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Being inconsistent with the time I apply toward improving my web development skill-set has been the #1 problem. I had previously completed about 20% of the FCC, but I decided to start over. Web development hasn't been a primary focus this past year. I love coding! Unfortunately, I haven't made it a priority. I learned about the 100 days of code challenge today. I had heard of it before, but had never learned what it was. So after starting over on the FCC, I quickly realized that reviewing the basics never hurts.
