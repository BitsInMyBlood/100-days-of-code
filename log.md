# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 18, 2018


**Today's Progress:** Began my 100 days of coding challenge by restarting my work toward completing FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Being inconsistent with the time I apply toward improving my web development skill-set has been the #1 problem. I had previously completed about 20% of the FCC, but I decided to start over. Web development hasn't been a primary focus this past year. I love coding! Unfortunately, I haven't made it a priority. I learned about the 100 days of code challenge today. I had heard of it before, but had never learned what it was. So after starting over on the FCC, I quickly realized that reviewing the basics never hurts. 

**Link to work:** 

### Day 1: November 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Resumed FCC. Currently working through the basic HTML sections. It's all stuff I know, but the purpose here fluency. I'm doing a little work on my own website, too. 

**Thoughts:** CatPhotoApp... yay! CSS refresher.It seems like the hour flew by. I don't feel like I got much done. But, it is progress! And My hour is banked! C you tomorrow!

### Day 2: November 20, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Resumed FCC. Today's section begins with 'Applied Visual Design'. 

**Thoughts:** The box shadow css looks really snazzy: box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.19), 0 6px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.23); opacity of 0.7 on hyperlinks does look nice. line-height, font-weight, #class defined css, hover, CSS Box Model, relative/absolute/fixed positioning, float, z-index, color theory, complimentary colors... WHEEE!

### Day 3: November 21, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Resumed FCC. Today's section continues 'Applied Visual Design: Adjusting the tone of color

**Thoughts:** hsl() hue(tint) saturation(grayness) lightness(white/blackness), Using hsl() is a bit confusing at first..I don't remember this! linear-gradient property of background-color, repeating-linear-gradient, transform:scale(x) and on hover, skewX(), shape manipulation kung-fu moon, making a heart with css ::before and ::after, css @keyframes, 

### Day 4: November 22, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Resumed FCC. Today's section continues 'Applied Visual Design: Animating objects

**Thoughts:** animation-fill-mode, animation-iteration-count: infinite, animation-timing-function. 

### Day 5: November 23, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Resumed FCC. Today's section continues 'Applied Visual Design: Change animation timing with keywords.

**Thoughts:** animation-timing-function linear and ease-out, cubic-bezier, applied accessibility, img alt text

### Day 6: November 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Resumed FCC. Today's section continues 'Applied Visual Design: Header landmark.

**Thoughts:** The importance of accurately using header, nav, footer tags for accissibility, audio content, figure, figcaption, form attributes including label, fieldset, legend, date, datetime, sr-only (hidden), contrast ratio, using descriptive anchor text, accesskey, tabindex. On to reponsive web design:

### Day 7: November 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Resumed FCC. Responsive web design: creating a media query.

**Thoughts:** Unlimited number of media queries. The formatting of the queries was satisfying.

### Day 8: November 26, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Resumed FCC. responsive images. 

**Thoughts:** retina images (thats new), the 4 viewport units: vw vh vmin vmax. CSS flexboxes, flex! display: flex; and flex-direction: row/column, alignment options,

### Day 9: November 27, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Resumed FCC. Flexbox justify content property. Align content property for flex items. cross-axis. align-items, 

**Thoughts:** Flex containers are interesting. They're simply a div with CSS defined for display: flex;, flex-wrap controls how items within the flex container will wrap or not. Manipulations for flex items: flex-shrink, flex-grow, flex-basis, flex shortcut, order, align-self! On to a new section, tomorrow: CSS Grid.

### Day 10! November 28, 2018

**Today's Progress:** I'm continuing FCC. Picking up at CSS grid. grid-template-columns, grid-template-rows, grid-column-gap, grid-row-gap - both very nice! But grid-gap is even nicer! grid-column and grid-row based on the 4 x 4 grid ( 1 / 4, 2 / 4, 3 / 4, 1 / 3, 2 / 3, 2 / 4 etc). justify-self: center, align-self: end, justify-items, align-items. Grid-template-areas! Whoa - next level stuff. grid-area, minmax... so may ways to define the grid! 

### Day 11 November 29, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Resuming FCC, finishing out the CSS grid section

**Thoughts:**  grid-template-columns, auto-fill, auto-fit. Remember about @media queries to control the layout on various screen sizes. Tomorrow I'll start on the tribute page project. I've done one last time through the FCC, but this time I've already got some new ideas.

### Day 12 November 30, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Completed the Tribute Page project

**Thoughts:**: https://codepen.io/bitsinmyblood/pen/QJzNXa

### Day 13 December 1, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Starting on "building a survey form"

**Thoughts**: Made some progress on the survey

### Day 14 December 2, 2018

**Today's Progress: Continuing the "Build a survey" project

**Thoughts**: Building the structure right now in terms of div's with description id's. The positioning of all the elements in the form is challenging.

### Day 15 December 3, 2018

**Today's Progress: Working on "Build a survey" project

**Thoughts:** The layout is a struggle for me. Positioning the elements of the form proves challenging. Brutal. Properly aligning the "select" dropdown where I want it is proving to be annoying.

### Day 16 December 4, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Back to FCC "Build a survey" project

**Thoughts:** Adding dropdown, radio buttons, completed the survey project! One major issue is, still, that styling. Specifically, the alignment and positioning of each element. Next project: Product Landing page. 

### Day 17 December 5, 2018

**Today's Progress: Began "Product Landing Page" project

**Thoughts:** I'm still annoyed at the alignment issues on the form, but for the sake of keeping my momentum going I'm moving on to the next project. Started the landing page.

## Day 18 December 6, 2018

**Today's Progress:** continued building the product landing page.

**Thoughts:** Making a mental note to go back and correct the formatting of these projects before I move on. Walking though the codepen tests doesn't guide you to style content or organize in div's, so I'm kind of confused about why that is. I would think that the if you're going to walk me through building it, why not walk me through building it in the most efficient and high quality way as possible? I continue to be surprised at how various elements position themselves.

### Day 19 December 7, 2018

**Today's Progress: Continuing the "product landing page" project.

**Thoughts:** again, I'm failing at styling these projects well. I suppose I'll go though and style them all better, at some point.

### Day 20 December 8, 2018

**Today's Progress: Worked on the "product landing page".

**Thoughts:** Had to cut it short, will resume tomorrow.

### Day 21 December 9, 2018

**Today's Progress:** working on the "product landing page."

**Thoughts:** Currently at 14/16 tests passed on this project. However, the I've added no styling. I think it's reasonable to plan on completing the functionality of the projects and passing the tests, followed by styling them. Ok, styled it a bit better. Used flexboxes, they're nice. On to "build a technical documentation page" project.

### Day 22 December 10, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Started the technical documentation page

**Thoughts**: Working on getting the media query right.
