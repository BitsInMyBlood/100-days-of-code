# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 18, 2018


**Today's Progress**: Began my 100 days of coding challenge by restarting my work toward completing FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Being inconsistent with the time I apply toward improving my web development skill-set has been the #1 problem. I had previously completed about 20% of the FCC, but I decided to start over. Web development hasn't been a primary focus this past year. I love coding! Unfortunately, I haven't made it a priority. I learned about the 100 days of code challenge today. I had heard of it before, but had never learned what it was. So after starting over on the FCC, I quickly realized that reviewing the basics never hurts.

**Thoughts:** The box shadow css looks really snazzy: box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.19), 0 6px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.23); opacity of 0.7 on hyperlinks does look nice. line-height, font-weight, #class defined css, hover, CSS Box Model, relative/absolute/fixed positioning, float, z-index, color theory, complimentary colors... WHEEE!

### Day 3: November 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Resumed FCC. Today's section continues 'Applied Visual Design: Adjusting the tone of color

**Thoughts:** hsl() hue(tint) saturation(grayness) lightness(white/blackness), Using hsl() is a bit confusing at first..I don't remember this! linear-gradient property of background-color, repeating-linear-gradient, transform:scale(x) and on hover, skewX(), shape manipulation kung-fu moon, making a heart with css ::before and ::after, css @keyframes,
